Identify what you think are the 5-10 most important omitted variables that bias results you care about. For each variable, you should estimate what direction the bias is in. If you can argue whether the bias is large or small, that is even better. State whether you have any variables available that may proxy (even imperfectly) for the omitted variable. Pay particular attention to whether each omitted variable bias is towards zero or away from zero. You will use this information to judge whether the effects you find are likely to be real, or whether they might be entirely an artifact of omitted variable bias.


We've identified several key omitted variables that we feel most influence the crime rate but are not represented in the data here.

1. Inflation Rate
2. Unemployment Rate
3. Consumer Price Index
4. Childhood Blood Lead Levels (with 18 year time lag)
5. Gini Coefficient
6. Youth unemployent
